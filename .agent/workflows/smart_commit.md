description: Format code with ruff and commit changes intelligently (style vs logic)
---

1. Run `ruff format .` to format the code.
// turbo
2. Check if there are any changes.
3. If there are changes from formatting, commit them with the message "Style: Apply ruff formatting".
4. Check if there are any other changes (logic, reports, etc.).
5. If there are other changes, commit them with a descriptive message (e.g., "Report: Update daily macro pulse" or ask user for message).
6. Push all commits to the remote repository.

Example usage: "Apply smart commit workflow" or "Format and commit"
